# RuuviTagIoTCourseWork
This is study project. I wanted to learn how to get data out of Ruuvi Tag -sensors. Built up also Azure IoT Hub and stored the data in database. 
For building a MQTT-gateway I used the code from this GitHub repo: https://github.com/Lalufu/ruuvi-mqtt --> only small changes required.
